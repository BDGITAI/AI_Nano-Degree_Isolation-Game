# AI_Nano-Degree_Isolation-Game

## 0. Project Details  

### Description

This project aims at building a game playing agent using adversarial method.
It consists in implementing the Minimax algorithm with beta pruning and iterative deepening search.
In this project we also define some custom heuristics and analyse how they perform over a series of game.
  
### Isolation Game  

The isolation game is a board game with two opponents. 
Rules can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_(board_game))
An Udacity video is also available :[Isolation explained](https://youtu.be/BYqGXP95QLc)
